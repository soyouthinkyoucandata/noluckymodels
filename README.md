# No Lucky Models
A Course about model validation from So You Think You Can Data?

Welcome to the environment setup for the "So You Think You Can Data?" model validation course! This repository contains everything you need to set up your environment and get started with the hands-on exercises.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of model validation and why traditional approaches often fail. You'll master key validation principles such as representativeness, independence, statistical significance, and structure preservation through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with data science libraries (pandas, NumPy)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- A computer with Python 3.9+ installed

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soyouthinkyoucandata/noluckymodels.git
cd ml-validation-course
```

Or download and extract the ZIP file from the course resources.

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup script to automatically install all required packages:

```bash
python setup.py
```

This script will:
- Check your Python version
- Install all required packages
- Create necessary directories
- Verify that everything is working properly

#### Option 2: Manual Setup with pip

If you prefer to install packages manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 3: Manual Setup with conda

If you use Anaconda or Miniconda:

```bash
conda create -n mlvalidation python=3.9
conda activate mlvalidation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Your Setup

After installation, run the verification notebook to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
jupyter notebook verification-notebook.ipynb
```

Run all cells in the notebook. If all checks pass, you're ready to start the course!

## Repository Structure

- `/notebooks`: Contains all guided exercises and challenges
- `/data`: Contains datasets used in the course
- `/solutions`: Contains reference implementations for all exercises
- `/resources`: Contains additional materials, readings, and cheat sheets

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. **Python Version**: Make sure you're using Python 3.9 or higher
2. **Package Installation Errors**: 
   - Try installing packages individually
   - Check for system-specific requirements (some packages need compilers or system libraries)
3. **Jupyter Notebook Issues**:
   - Make sure Jupyter is installed: `pip install jupyter`
   - Try running: `jupyter notebook --version` to verify the installation

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Windows**: Make sure Python is added to your PATH during installation
- **Mac**: You might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`
- **Linux**: You might need to install `tkinter` separately for some visualizations
